### Factozon

## About the project
Factozon is part of one of the Factoria F5 Bootcamp projects. The main goals of it are :

<!-- - To acquire the ability to create a fully functional database, using the MVC (Model View Controller) design pattern, using PHP, and Laravel. 

- Give the admin the ability to do CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete).

- Implement the rights depending if you are a  Guest, Admin or User.

- Understand the Laravel's logic.

- Use a framework (in our case, we choose Tailwind) -->


## What is Factozon about?
Factozon is a web page where you can see stores and their products, purchase and sell your own stock! .

As user you will be able to see eshops and create a Store with your own made selection of products to sell if you want, also this project does give you tools to customize the store and items. If you are interested in one of the products click on them to see more details about it.

If you add an item by mistake or you don't want some product on your own Factozon Store you will be able to remove them without any worries. 

You will be able to access your profile and modify your data such as email, name and profile picture. And you will also have the chance to remove the seller profile from the account.
